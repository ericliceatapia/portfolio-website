      <h1>I am <span class="name">Eric Licea Tapia</span>.</h1>

      <p>
        I was born in 2004 in Dallas, Texas. I am a first-generation
        Mexican-American college student currently studying at Texas Christian
        University.
      </p>
      <h2>My roots</h2>
      <p>
        As the oldest of three children to immigrant parents, I deeply value the
        sacrifices they made to provide a better future for us. My family comes
        from Los Rodriguez, a small town outside of San Miguel de Allende,
        Guanajuato, Mexico. Their resilience and dedication inspire me, and I
        strive to honor their journey in everything I do.
      </p>
      <h2>My interests</h2>
      <p>
        I love exploring new hobbies, but my current top three are exercising,
        listening to music, and tinkering with technology. I enjoy activities
        that challenge me physically, mentally, and intellectually. Some argue
        that passively engaging in activies such as listening to music or
        watching movies isn't a "real hobby," but I believe it's about how you
        interact with an activity rather than just doing it.
      </p>
      <h2>My goals</h2>
      <h3>As a developer</h3>
      <p>
        My goal is to craft timeless, beautiful, and functional code--code that
        not only functions seamlessly today but shapes the future of technology.
        I aim to push boundaries, merging creativity with technical excellence
        to build code that is maintainable, scalable, and adaptable for the
        future.
      </p>
      <h3>In school</h3>
      <p>
        I see education as a powerful tool. My goal is to uplift and empower
        students from similar backgrounds, helping them realize their potential
        and use their time in school as a launchpad for greatness. I want to
        create a path for others to follow and prove that our backgrounds do not
        define our limits.
      </p>
      <h3>Professionally</h3>
      <p>
        My ambition is to lead and inspire. I want to grow into a position where
        I can drive innovation, challenge conventional thinking, and lead
        groundbreaking teams in the technology industry. My vision is to
        contribute to solutions that redefine how we interact with the modern
        world.
      </p>
      <h3>In life</h3>
      <p>
        I envision a life of depth, purpose, and connection. A life where I am
        free to explore, learn, and grow. I hope to understand my roots, embrace
        my heritage, and live in Mexico, immersing myself in the stories and
        traditions that shaped my family. Ultimately, I want to build a life
        where my future children inherit a legacy of curiosity, ambition, and
        resilience, just as my parents did for me.
