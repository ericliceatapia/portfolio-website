    <p>
      My name is <span class="name">Eric Licea Tapia</span>. I was born in 2004 in <span class="name">Dallas,
        Texas</span>. I am a first generation Mexican-American college student currently studying at the
      <span class="name">Texas Christian University</span>, pursuing a degree in Computer Science.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am the oldest of three children to immigrant parents, who gave up everything to provide a better future
      for us. I elevate their stories because it is their sacrifice that brought me here. My family is from a
      small town outside of San Miguel de Allende, Guanajuato, Mexico, called Los Rodriguez.
